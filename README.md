<ins>Title: </ins>Analyzing Web Graph Dataset using Ranking,Clustering and Centrality Metrics  
<ins>Abstract: </ins>  
*Network  analysis  is  very  useful  in  deep  understanding  of  the  structure  and  relationship  among  the  entities  of  aconnected network. Using different network analysis algorithms and centrality measures, important characteristic featuresof a network can be derived. In this paper, a portion of the well-known dataset of Stanford Web graph has been analyzedusing  different  network  centrality  measures  and  Web  page  ranking  algorithms  to  identify  more  significant  web  pages  inthe web graph. Later, network clustering was performed to partition the web graph into more densely connected clusters.According  to  the  analysis  results,  it  has  been  seen  that  some  web  pages  can  be  identified  as  more  important  based  ondifferent ranking scores and centrality metrics. Also, the clustering result shows that the network isnâ€™t a uniformly densenetwork,  rather  it  shows  community  structure  property  like  most  other  real  life  networks.*
